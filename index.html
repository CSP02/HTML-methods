        define the methods. That means here def tag is used to define the methods and name attribute as the method name
        Remember that these def tags will be removed once the page is loaded so that you cannot see the code inside this def tags
        So the code inside these tags only works once you call them using as a tag name
        run this file and inspect the changes in html so you can know more
