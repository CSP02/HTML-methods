# HTML methods
 A package that can handle methods in html(for non repetative code).

# What is Methods?
 Have you ever get frustated of writing the same code in html to get what you want. Then here you are use this package? to make it easy with just a class and an attribute called **"as"**.

# Usage:
 - Methods package is very simple to use.
 - All you need to do is to set the class name to ***CThis*** which means **copy this** and the attribute I defined basically called as ***as*** which should be the name of your method or the code you want to copy and use.
 - After that set the class name to ***PHere*** which means **paste here** where ever you want to use that code in your HTML.
 - That's it.
 **Note: You can copy any code that means if you want to copy the code which is at the bottom it will work.**

# Example:

```html
<div class="CThis" as="test1">Writing this code at the beginning</div>
<div class="PHere" as="test1"></div>
<div class="PHere" as="BottomCode"></div>
<div class="CThis" as="BottomCode">This is the code at bottom yet it will work</div>
```
